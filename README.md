## Odia Editor

This is project aims to implement a text editor with support for markdown and
yaml with a custom phonetic input method for odia text. Also we aim to provide
a method extracting odia text from images to text files to speed up
digitisation of existing odia literature. (This feature is experimental as of
this version, consequently the text extraction is slow and inaccurate). 

## Notes for developers

This project is developed entirely in Javascript.
It uses Electron, React, markdown-it, odia-keyboard and tesseract-ocr.
